    <h1>Behind the Beer</h1>
    <p>
      Brainstem started out of a desire to try something new.
      After a few brews from a Mr. Beer Kit and a year and a half long hiatus,
      Brainstem started brewing regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Mr. Beer kit, Brainstem graduated to the setup nearly all
      homebrewers start with: a plastic bucket, a big pot, and a lot of malt
      extract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, Brainstem brews on a classic, three vessel system in a row-home
      in West-Philly, Pennsylvania, USA. So, come on down for a brew and good
      'ole time!
