Site for Brainstem Brewing. Powered by Gatsby (ain't that great?)

To set it up locally, you can clone it or follow the instructions below from Gatsby:

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new brainstem-site https://github.com/chris-s-friedman/brainstem-brewing-web
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd brainstem-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `brainstem-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
